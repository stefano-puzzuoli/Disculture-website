			<h2>Stefano Puzzuoli</h2>
			<p class = "nopic">Stefano took care of styling various parts of the website, such as the Navigation bar and the footer. He also dealt with the styling of the images and the paragraphs and their alignment. In the end he also added comments to all of the code. Two mistakes Stefano made were not using shorthand properties: he found himself repeating “margin-top”, “margin-bottom”, “margin-left”, “margin-right” instead of just “margin”; Redundant selectors: He started writing style starting off with all the typography, and then worked on the structure, and finally on styling all the colors and backgrounds. Since he didn’t focus on just one element at a time, he found himself accidentally typing out a redundant style declaration. </p>

			<h2>Emily Whyte</h2>
			<p class="nopic">Emily chose the fonts which would best suit the style of the website and assigned them to the appropriate sections. She added the icon in the browser tab and created classes and IDs for CSS styling. Emily also checked the code of each page to ensure every member followed the general layout of tags in their HTML. One mistake Emily made was choosing a picture of Irish landscape for the main webpage while the other pictures were cities. This did not match with the rest of the page and looked bad. Another mistake she made at the beginning was aiming for a website that was too simple, which did not provide enough information.</p>

			<h2>James Farrelly</h2>
			<p class="nopic">James did the styling for the forms as well as the styling done to each header. He also designed the logo we chose to use as well as the overall concept for what the page would look like.James made the mistake of not being able to get the background image to center with the header in the CSS and therefor had to do it in the HTML. He also couldn't style the form the way he wanted as it messed with the aligned text. </p>

			<h2>Manny Idelegbagbon </h2>
			<p class="nopic">Manny made the Image grid on the Homepage, which took a long time to get right. He also design and styled the background of the website. As well as designing the media queries for the whole website. Manny' mistakes were that he couldn't style the margins between the images on the homepage exactly how he wanted and therefor there is different sized spacing between them and he also had soem difficulties with the media queries for the image grid in the main page.</p>
