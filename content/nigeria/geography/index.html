                    <p>The majority of Nigeria has a tropical monsoon climate. This kind of climate has warm temperatures all year round. Temperatures ranging from 25-30 degrees are normal. The North of Nigeria is very close to the Sahara dessert and due to this it has a hot dessert like climate. Temperatues in the north are often in the high 30s. The south of Nigeria has a more temperate climate as it is close to the sea. The south of Nigeria is exposed to south Atlantic winds which helps cool the temperature. The south recieves much more rain and regular temperature is around 18-20 degrees.Nigeria has two seasons; The rainy season and the dry season. The rainy season begins in March spans until the end of September. During this season, rain is very common. The rain is often very heavy and can casue flooding. When its not raining the weather is hot and humid. The dry season starts in October and ends in March. During the dry season there are minimal clouds. This leaves the country exposed to the sun rays, increasing the temperature. In mid December a dusty wind from the Sahara comes across Nigeria. This is known as the Harmattan, it protects the country, people and crops from the intense heat.</p>

                <div class="right-left">
                    <p>The natural vegetation in Nigeria is split into two main categorys due to the savanna and monsoon climates. The monsoon climates are home to tall forests, swamps and rain forests. Coffee beans grow in the western forests. Towards the more temperate climate in the south there are beaches and a variety of trees like palm and mahogany. There isnt much vegetation in the regions of Nigeria with the savanna climate. Nigeria has a great diversity of wildlife. In the forests there are gorrilas, monkeys, baboons, crocodiles, lizards and snakes. Inland there are hippos, giffafes and elephants. In the savanna, there are zebras, antelopes, gazelles, lions, leopards, hyenas and other wildcats.</p>

                    <p>Nigeria is a very large country, it's approximately 924,000 kilometers squared in area. The terain in the south and north is generally flat. Both merge into hills and plateaus in the central areas of the country. The southeast however has mountainous terrain. A plateau is an area of high land. The highest point in Nigeria is in the Mambilla Plateau in Taraba State. The plateau is about 60 km long and has an average height of 5,249ft. The highest point is a mountain called Chappal Waddi or Gangirwal mountain. It stands 7,936 ft tall. Getting closer to the ground, the Niger Delta is located in the south of Nigeria. This is where the river Niger discharges into the Atlantic Ocean. The source of the Niger is in Guinea and streches 4,180 km through Guinea, Mali, Niger, Benin and Nigeria. The river serves as a source of water to many people. While there are no actual desert areas in Nigeria, the northern part of Nigeria borders with a region known as the Sahel. Sahel in Arabic means "shore." The 5,000-kilometer stretch of Savannah, which forms the edge of the Sahara Desert next to Nigeria has been a problem for Nigerian government and citizens.</p>
