                    <p>Archaeological research has shown that people were already living in Nigeria as early as 11,000 BC and perhaps earlier south-eastern Nigeria. Microlithic and ceramic industries were developed by savanna sheep farmers from at least the 4000 BC and were continued by subsequent agricultural communities. The earliest recorded Nigerian culture is the Nok culture that thrived between 1500 BC and 200 AD on the Jos Plateau in north-eastern Nigeria. The Nok people were leaders in ancient metal work, their derivation of advanced metal casting techniques such as the lost-wax process for tools and weaponry are some of first-known applications of the craft. Sculptures found throughout south-western Nigeria indicate that the Nok Culture was a centered around art of a world renowned caliber. Information is lacking from the 1000s BC following the Nok ascendancy, but by 2000 BC there was active trade from Ancient Egypt via Nubia through the Sahara to the forest with the savanna people acting as intermediaries in exchanges of various goods. Long before 1500 most of Nigeria was divided into states identified with contemporary ethnic groups. These states included the Igbo Kingdom of Nri, the Benin Kingdom, Yoruba kingdoms, the Hausa cities, and Nupe. As well as these states numerous small states to the west and south of Lake Chad were absorbed or displaced in the course of the expansion of Kanem, which was centered to the northeast of Lake Chad. Bornu, initially the western province of Kanem, became independent in the late 14th century. Other states probably existed but the absence of archaeological data prevents accurate dating.</p>

                <h2>British Rule</h2>
                <div class="right-left">
                    <p>Up until the 19th centuary, Nigeria was a free ruling country. The country did not have one over-rulling body but was instead dominated by various empires that ruled over different regions of Nigeria. These empires included the Edo Benin Empire and the Islamic Kanim Borno Empire in the north and west, and the Igbo kingdom of Onitsha in the southeast and various Hausa-Fulani kingdoms. The British began their colonization of the area by slowly moving around the area and defeating different power heads in order to obtain more trading goods. The British government then assumed direct control of the Royal Niger Company’s territories in the late 1870s, the northern areas were renamed the Protectorate of Northern Nigeria, and the land in the Niger delta and along the lower reaches of the river was added to the Niger Coast Protectorate, which was renamed the Protectorate of Southern Nigeria. Lagos was the capital of the south, and Zungeru the capital of the north. On January 1, 1914, following the recommendations of Sir Frederick Lugard, who was the first to explore Nigeria on behalf of Britain, the two protectorates were amalgamated to form the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria under a single governor-general resident in Lagos. Between 1919 and 1954 the title reverted to governor. Many changes came with British rule.<br> Western education along with the English language <br> Christianity spread during the period <br>Transportation<br> Communication</p>

                    <p>The Nigerian economy became based on the export of cash crops. Areas with lucrative crops such as cacao and peanuts profited, while many people in other parts of the country had to migrate to work elsewhere. Two tiers of government emerged, central and local. The central government, presided over by the governor-general and was accountable to the secretary for the colonies in London. To prevent any united opposition to the commonwealth, the British adopted a divide-and-rule policy, keeping Nigerian groups separate from one another as much as possible. Nigerian authorities were appointed in the north, where the spread of Western education by Christian missionaries was strongly resisted by Muslim leaders. In the south the British occasionally created a political hierarchy where there had been none before. In most cases they ruled through those who were most easiest to persuade or influence. Because Western education and Christianity spread rapidly in the south and not in the north, development was much slower in the north, and the growing disparity between north and south later caused political tensions. Nigeria became an independent country within the Commonwealth on 1 October 1960. A governor-general represented the British monarch as head of state and was appointed by the Crown on the advice of the Nigerian prime minister. An Executive Council, made up entirely of Nigerians, was led by the Prime Minister, Alhaji Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa. Its first government was a coalition of conservative parties, and it came into power on the back of increasingly enthusiastic demands for political independence from colonial powers that swept across much of the Africa during the middle of the 20th Century. The British recognised that the independence drive had started to gain traction after World War Two, and they steered the country toward a self-governance model. The conservative coalition government that came into power on 1 October comprised the Nigerian People’s Congress (NPC), the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons (NCNC), and the Action Group (AG) constituted the opposition. The NPC was largely Hausa and Muslim, the NCNC mainly Igbo and Christian, and the AG mostly Yoruba and relatively liberal. The political divisions between the parties were obvious and acute.</p>

                <h2>The Biafran War - Nigerian Civil War</h2>

                    <p>In 1960, Nigeria gained independence from Britain. Six years later, the Muslim Hausas in northern Nigeria began massacring the Christian Igbos in the region, prompting tens of thousands of Igbos to flee to the east, where their people were more dominant. The Igbos doubted that Nigeria’s oppressive military government would allow them to develop, or even survive, so on May 30, 1967, Lieutenant Colonel Odumegwu Ojukwu and other non-Igbo representatives of the area established the Republic of Biafra, comprising several states of Nigeria. After diplomatic efforts by Nigeria failed to reunite the country, war between Nigeria and Biafra broke out in July 1967. Ojukwu’s forces made some initial advances, but Nigeria’s superior military strength gradually reduced Biafran territory. The state lost its oil fields–its main source of revenue–and without the funds to import food, an estimated one million of its civilians died as a result of severe malnutrition. On January 11, 1970, Nigerian forces captured the provincial capital of Owerri, one of the last Biafran strongholds, and Ojukwu was forced to flee to the Ivory Coast. Four days later, Biafra surrendered to Nigeria.</p>
