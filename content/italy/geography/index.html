					<p>Italy experiences hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters, but in truth, the overall temperature and weather depends on the location within the country. In fact, one may experience completely different weather and temperatures in the north, as compared to the south. Italy has multiple climate types, including ice caps, tundra, Mediterranean, and Oceanic. It experiences much of its colder winter in the north due to its altitude and proximity to the Alps. As for Southern Italy, it is surrounded by warm ocean air, and the heat of its summers can get quite extreme.
					The broad collection of weather types, ranging from freezing to fiery, makes Italy a diverse region in terms of weather. The Mediterranean influences a lot of Italy’s weather and climate, making a large portion of the country warmer. The typical weather in Italy is dependent on the seasons. The rainy season occurs in the winter with temperatures that reach as low as 30 degrees in Venice. Recorded highs in the winter reach up to 60 degrees in the Cagliari area. Unsurprisingly, central regions of Italy, including Lazio, Marche, Tuscany, and Umbria, are quite temperate and mild. Central Italy’s summer shows little difference in comparison to its winter. Italy seems to have one constant, a rainy winter with rarely a dry summer.

				<h2>Flora and Fauna</h2>
				<div class="right-left">
				<p>Due to the long phase of settlement of the Italian peninsula and the strong Roman high culture, the natural vegetation and forests in Italy had been destroyed very early. Crops, pastures and vineyards replaced the natural vegetation. Nevertheless, one of the hallmarks of contemporary Italy was established by man - who could imagine Tuscany without olive groves, cypresses, pines and vineyards. A textbook example of an idyllic landscape - shaped by man. Beyond the three main plant species that are found nearly everywhere in Italy (holly, cork oak and pine), original vegetation has been mainly preserved in the more remote border areas and on Sardinia. Similiar to plant life, Italy's wild animals were eradicated almost entirely. Today, native animals, such as eagles, ibexes, chamois, bears, wolves and marmots, can only be found in isolated enclaves and natural parks. However, there's now a limited number of bears and wolves living in the wild, many of which have migrated from neighbouring Slovenia.

				<h2>Terrain</h2>
				<div class="left-right">
					<img src="../../../assets/images/italy_terrain.jpg" alt=" snowy Italian Alps mountain"/>
					<p>Despite many beaches, islands and the reputation of being a bathing paradise in the Mediterranean Sea, mountains and hills characterise the map of Italy. Two big mountain ranges define the country: the powerful mountain massif of the Alps in the north and the Apennine mountain range extending over two thirds of the peninsula. Both mountain ranges are the result of the African and European tectonic plates having been dominating the Italian countryside for 2 million years.
